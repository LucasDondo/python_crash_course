# üêç Python Crash Course

This is just a repo I created to practice a little bit of Git and GitHub while learning Python with [the great Eric Matthes book](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+crash+course+2nd+edition&hl=en&sxsrf=AJOqlzUdIDxMvYSfafvDEl0aE7yv4DbvHg%3A1673492124280&source=hp&ei=nHa_Y8mjDqD25OUPlbGEgA0&iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY7-ErLMFacpkwTxpuv3iwI3uHAv6tifs&gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0TM8rNrNMN0k2YPSSL6gsycjPU0guSizOUEjOLy0qTlUwyktRSE3JLMnMzwMAd2AQQg&oq=Python+crash+&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMYAjIECCMQJzIECAAQQzIICC4QgAQQywEyBAgAEEMyCAgAEIAEEMsBMggIABCABBDLATIICAAQgAQQywEyCAgAEIAEEMsBMgQIABBDMgQIABBDOgcIIxDqAhAnOgQILhBDOgUIABCABFChBVicF2C0JmgBcAB4AIABW4gBhwiSAQIxM5gBAKABAbABCg&sclient=gws-wiz).

# ü§¨ _"Why on earth did you write this horrible code!?"_

This kind of comments can by rewritten in a more friendly way, such as how ChatGPT suggested: _"Hey Dondi, I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if there might be some room for improvement in this code you've written. Would you mind if we took a look at it together?"

Finally, if you have a billion dollar idea w/ one of the projects living in this repo, you have two options:
1. üí∏ `CTRL + C` + `CTRL + V` the code, run away, and become a billionare.
2. ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèª [Create an issue](github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues/new) and work together to make that brilliant idea happen!
