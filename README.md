# 🐍 Python Crash Course

This is just a repo I created to practice a little bit of Git and GitHub while learning Python with [the great Eric Matthes book](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/).

If you have a billion-dollar idea w/ one of the projects living in this repo, you have two options:
1. 💸 `CTRL + C` + `CTRL + V` the code, run away, and become a billionaire.
2. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 [Create an issue](github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues/new) and work together to make that brilliant idea happen!

# 🤬 _"Why on earth did you write that horrible code!?"_

This kind of comment can be rewritten in a more friendly way, such as how [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) suggested: _"Hey Dondi, I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if there might be some room for improvement in the code you've written. Would you mind if we took a look at it together?"_

# 🧠 Learnings? Here they are!

_Dondi! Please tell me you learned at least a bit while doing all these projects!_ Yes, of course! And there is more! Since some of those learnings were related to issues, the notes about those learning are written in the descriptions of the issues. _Which issues?_ [This ones.](https://github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues?q=label%3ALearning)

# 📺 What have you done?

If you know this book, you know that it has three main projects: one about data analytics, one about web development and one about game development.

In the future, I may work in data analytics or web-dev, but I'd never work in the videogame industry. However, here are demos of games I coded:

- 🏹 The BowMan: simple and colorful

- 👽 Alien Invasion! Old but gold (and renewed, built with emojis).
