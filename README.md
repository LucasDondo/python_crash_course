# 🐍 Python Crash Course

This is just a repo I created to practice a little bit of Git and GitHub while learning Python with [the great Eric Matthes book](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/).

# 🤬 _"Why on earth did you write this horrible code!?"_

This kind of comments can by rewritten in a more friendly way, such as how [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) suggested: _"Hey Dondi, I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if there might be some room for improvement in this code you've written. Would you mind if we took a look at it together?"_

Finally, if you have a billion dollar idea w/ one of the projects living in this repo, you have two options:
1. 💸 `CTRL + C` + `CTRL + V` the code, run away, and become a billionare.
2. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 [Create an issue](github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues/new) and work together to make that brilliant idea happen!

# 🧠 Learnings? Here they are!

_Dondi! Please tell me you learnt at least some bit while doing all these projects!_ Yes, of course! And there is more! Since some of those learnings were related to issues, the notes about those learning are written in the issues descriptions. _Which issues?_ [This ones.](https://github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues?q=label%3ALearning)
