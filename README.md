# 🐍 Python Crash Course

This is just a repo I created to practice a little bit of Git and GitHub while learning Python with [the great Eric Matthes book](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e/).

# 🤬 _"Why on earth did you write this horrible code!?"_

This kind of comments can by rewritten in a more friendly way, such as how ChatGPT suggested: _"Hey Dondi, I hope you're doing well. I was wondering if there might be some room for improvement in this code you've written. Would you mind if we took a look at it together?"

Finally, if you have a billion dollar idea w/ one of the projects living in this repo, you have two options:
1. 💸 `CTRL + C` + `CTRL + V` the code, run away, and become a billionare.
2. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 [Create an issue](github.com/LucasDondo/python_crash_course/issues/new) and work together to make that brilliant idea happen!
